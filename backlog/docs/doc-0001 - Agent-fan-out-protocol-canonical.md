# Loop protocol pointer

This board no longer carries the loop protocol. Its canonical files live in the agent-docs checkout
at `~/repos/agent-docs/sources/loop/`:

- `contract.md` - what every loop root obeys at run time, on any harness.
- `harness-pi.md`, `harness-claude.md`, `harness-codex.md` - one per harness.
- `planner.md` - preparing a loop; the loop skill reads it.

In a loop, running agents read only their goal, the contract and their harness file. Lanes read only
their brief. Repository facts for loops live in this repository's `LOOP.md`. Ignore any older full
copy of the fan-out protocol: it is stale.
